# RecursiveSynthVC

An expressive voice conversion model that is able to perform cross-speaker style transfer improved by self-generated synthetic expressive data.

# TODO's
- [ ] Melspectrogram-based for lightweight training and explicit duration control 
- [ ] BigVGAN V2 generator
- [ ] Large Scale Training for zero-shot voice conversion
